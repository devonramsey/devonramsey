    <h2> Devon Ramsey Bio</h2>
    <p> My course work as a Quantitative Economics major has given me a strong
      background in quantitative assessment and statistical programming and my
      course work as a Computer Science major has strengthened my programming
      skills. My professors have aptly prepared me for an internship in research
      and analysis.</p>
    <p> As my resume indicates, I am currently employed as a Co-Director of a
      new program call BookMatch, which has given me experience collaborating
      with a small group to organize events and implement the program at local
      schools.This position requires strong communication skills because I am
      responsible for contacting parents, principals and librarians, informing
      them about the program, and asking for their assistance. </p>
    <p>During the summer of 2015 I worked as a clinician for Lindamood-Bell
      Learning Processes, instructing students in reading and math. As a high
      school student, I privately tutored students in Algebra, Statistics and
      Calculus. I was also chosen by the high school faculty to be one of
      two campus AVID tutor, working  with over twenty students who were
      struggling academically in Pre-Algebra, Geometry, and English.</p>
    <p>I also have office experience; during the summer of 2014 I worked at a
      local medical practice where I answered phones, greeted patients and
      handled routine office tasks.</p>
